        <h1>The Rules of Rummy</h1>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of Rummy is to get rid of all of your cards. This is accomplished by "melding" (putting cards on the table), "laying off" (adding to someone else's cards), and by discarding.</p>
        <h2>Dealing</h2>
        <p>In a typical game, 7 cards are dealt to each player when there are 3 or 4 players, while 10 are dealt for 2-player games.</p>
        <p>After dealing, the top card is flipped and this forms the start of the "discard pile."</p>
        <h2>Turns</h2>
        <p>Each turn consists of 3 steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Drawing:</b> To start your turn, select either the face-down <b>deck</b> or the face-up <b>discard pile</b> to draw a card from. If you choose the <b>discard pile</b>, you will not be able to discard the same card that turn.</li>
            <li><b>Playing cards:</b> You can try to get rid of cards by playing as many of them as possible. You can <b>meld</b> and/or <b>lay off</b> cards any number of times, or not at all.</li>
            <li><b>Discarding:</b> To end your turn, select a card and <b>discard</b> it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Melding</h2>
        <p>You can get rid of cards (playing them onto the table) by creating a <b>meld</b>. A meld consists of <b>3 or more cards</b>. There are two valid forms of melds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <b>run</b> is a contiguous sequence of cards. By default, runs must consist of the same <b>suit</b>.</li>
            <li>A <b>set</b> is a set of cards of the same <b>rank</b>. By default, sets <i>cannot</i> contain two cards of the same suit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Laying off</h2>
        <p>The other way to shrink your hand is to <b>lay off</b> cards. If you have cards that can contribute to an existing meld on the table, you can add them to the meld.</p>
        <h2>Jokers</h2>
        <p>If enabled, <b>jokers</b> act as <b>wild cards</b>. They can take the place of any card in a <b>meld</b>. They can also be "displaced" when <b>laying off</b>.</p>
        <h2>Going out</h2>
        <p>A round of Rummy ends when a player runs out of cards in their hand ("going out"). The player that goes out wins the round.</p>
        <p>You can <b>go out</b> by <b>melding</b>, <b>laying off</b>, or <b>discarding</b> your last cards. A variant of the game requires that you <b>discard</b> to go out, so you must leave at least one card in your hand to discard when you meld or lay off.</p>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>When a player <b>goes out</b>, the remaining hands are <b>scored</b>, and their values are added to the winner's score.</p>
        <p>Number cards are worth their ordinal rank. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 when they are low, or 11 when they are high. Jokers are worth 15.</p>
        <blockquote><b>Note:</b> In Super Rummy, the score you see only counts rounds that took place since you joined the lobby. If you join late, your scores may be different than what other players see.</blockquote>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>In Super Rummy, the mouse and/or keyboard can be used to play the game. You can choose between mouse and keyboard controls, or use them both at the same time.</p>
        <h3>Mouse</h3>
        <p>To <b>draw</b> a card, click on the pile you want to draw from (the deck or the discard pile).</p>
        <p>To play a <b>meld</b>, click on each card to <b>select</b> it. If you've selected a legal meld, a <kbd>Meld</kbd> button will appear in the lower-right corner.</p>
        <p>To <b>lay off</b> one or more cards, click on each card to <b>select</b> it. If the cards you selected can be layed off, a <kbd>Lay</kbd> button will appear in the lower-right corner. After clicking it, click on the <b>meld</b> that you want to lay onto.</p>
        <p>To <b>discard</b> a card and end your turn, <b>select</b> the card and click the <kbd>Discard</kbd> button that appears.</p>
        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p>In many cases, several keys can be used to perform the same action, depending on the layout that's most comfortable to you. They will be shown together here.</p>
        <p>To draw a card from the <b>deck</b>, press <span><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>`</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd><kbd>,</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></span></p>
        <p>To draw a card from the <b>discard pile</b>, press <span><kbd>0</kbd><kbd>-</kbd><kbd>=</kbd><kbd>E</kbd><kbd>.</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></span></p>
        <p>To <b>select</b> a card, press a number key, <kbd>1 - 0</kbd>. To select cards after the 10th card, use <kbd>Shift</kbd>. For example, <span><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>2</kbd></span> selects the 12th card.</p>
        <p>You can also select the card you just drew with <span><kbd>-</kbd><kbd>=</kbd></span>.</p>
        <p>To <b>deselect</b> all cards, press <span><kbd>`</kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd></span></p>
        <p>To create a <b>meld</b> or <b>lay off</b> cards, select cards and press <span><kbd>Enter</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></span></p>
        <p>When laying off, press <kbd>1 - 0</kbd> corresponding to the highlighted <b>meld</b> you want to lay onto. Alternatively, <kbd>Esc</kbd> will cancel.</p>
        <p>To <b>discard</b>, select a card and press <span><kbd>Backspace</kbd><kbd>Delete</kbd></span></p>
        <blockquote><b>Tip:</b> You can press <kbd>=</kbd>, then <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to quickly discard the last drawn card.</blockquote>
